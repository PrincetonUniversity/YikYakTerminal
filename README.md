Yik Yak Command Line for College IT

Are students using YikYak to voice their concerens about broken printers and slow Wi-Fi?
Too underfunded to afford a full-time intern to browse YikYak?

Yik Yak Command Line + YakMining + CSV File Keyword search = Easy Life

YakMining (http://duckpond.wesleyan.edu/2015/04/04/yakmining-part/) adds a 'write to CSV' function to the Yik Yak Command Line. Then we can easily search the output file for key words such as "printer", "broken", "wifi", etc.

Could potentially be applied to identify other types of issues on campus. 


To do: 

1. Actually write the CSV search script.
2. Figure out how to Chron this so it runs automatically every half-hour.
